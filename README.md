# potluck_home

`Created this potluck home for my sub team's weekend potluck event.` The webpage consists of a countdown date timer, a small bit of dynamic html injection, and some form request data. Backend is Flask, on a locally hosted postgre db.

`Naturally wanted to include a Looker viz to display who was bringing what to the event` so I made a connection to postgre in my Looker, modeled out some basic data, then created a look which is embedded in the webpage. There are some embedded javascript events that refresh the iframe on click.

>This was a fun little weekend creation!
